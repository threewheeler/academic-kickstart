I am a post graduate student in Beijing University of Posts and Telecomunications, working in the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I work on machine learning and deep learning methods for intelligent transportation systems. I'm generally interested in transportation mode detection and traffic flow prediction based on spatio-temporal data and methods. If you have any ideas about this field and its related machine learning or deep learning methods, please mail me.

Additionally, I'm currently the CTO of Finerit.com. It is welcomed to discuss any technical issues with me using email.
